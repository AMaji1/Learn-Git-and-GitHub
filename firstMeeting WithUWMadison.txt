My first online meeting with Line and Bernie and their graduate students. 

I had a brief meeting with Dominic regarding the problems of getting a work permit in Sweden.

Dominic added me in the Slack group.

I am also added to the reading group. 

Dominic will share some interesting papers on optimization on Thursday.
